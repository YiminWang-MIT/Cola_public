		Welcome to DOC++ version 3.00
		



DOC++ is a documentation system for C++ and Java programs capable of
generating output for both, HTML and LaTeX. After augmenting C++ or Java
source code with special comments, DOC++ will extract a documentation ready
for viewing with a HTML viewer (Netscape is recommended) or for processing
with LaTeX. The documentation may include all inheritance dependencies and
a full class graph.


CHANGES FROM V2.0
=================

A lot has changed since the last version. We have redesigned the syntax for
doc++ comments according to the conventions used in JavaDoc. This makes
doc++ easier to understand and your sources look nicer. Notice that these
Changes are not(!) backward compatible. However a rudimentary conversion
utility that assists you in upgrading your files is provided.  It is called
like this: cat <oldfile> | promote | promote > <newfile>

 
INSTALLATION:
=============

Installation of DOC++ is a matter of two seconds:

(1) Copy the executables bin/doc++ and bin/docify to any location in
    your path (don't forget to rehash!).
(2) Copy the latex style file docxx.sty to a directory where latex
    can find it.



USAGE:
======

For your first run try building the documentation for DOC++:

(1) cd to the doc directory.

(2) Building the LaTeX documentation:
(2.a)   Type 'make tex' to build file docxx.tex.
(2.b)   Process docxx.tex twice by typing two times 'latex docxx.tex'.
	Note: You will need a running version of LaTeX2e (!) to perform
	this step.
(2.c)   View the documentation with 'xdvi docxx.dvi' or have it printed
	by typing 'dvips docxx.dvi'. The printed version should be
	identical to the one found in docxx.ps.

(3) Building the HTML documentation:
(3.a)   Type 'make' to build the html files.
(3.b)   Start up your HTML-viewer on file index.html, e.g. by typing
	'netscape index.html'.


DOCIFYING YOUR CLASSES:
=======================

For getting started with docifying your own headers, try out our docify
program. Asume you have a C++ header file myheader.hh, then you go with

> docify myheader.hh mydocifiedheader.hh

This should add a ManMemo section (///) to all public and protected
methods/classes etc it finds.

    WARNING: This program has not been tested intensively!

Please report on problems (and success) to doc++@zib-berlin.de.



COMPILATION:
============

If you need to compile doc++ (note on DOS systems it is called docxx),
edit the Makefile to your needs and 'make all'. (On DOS systems you will
need to 'make CCC=gcc LD=gcc dos'. This requires, of course, gcc to be
installed on your system).
