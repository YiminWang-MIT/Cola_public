Introduction
</h2>
This page describes the user-interface of the TMA-software.
The transformation from focal plane to target coordinates is done
 by a multidimensional polynomial. The parameters which characterize
this polynomial (transfer coefficients and powers) must be stored in a
a single file. This file can be build by hand or with the aid of a
tool which is also part of the TMA-software. This tool called bundle 
combines the parameter files obtained from analysis  programms.<p>

The usage of the reconstruction functions within C is described in this
section.
 All prototypes and structures are defined in 
TMA/TraceMachine.h. You can also safely include this file in 
C++ programms without the extern "C" mechanism.<p>

The reconstruction software is implemented in an object-based manner as
far as the interface is concerned. Instead of function 
which calculates the target coordinates from a certain focal plane vector,
 we have  a machine (class) which has the ability to perform
the described transformation (class-method).
This is exactly the situation we encounter in real world: 
The machine at hand is our spectrometer - with the only difference that it 
does the transformation in the opposite direction. 
Like in real life the first thing  you have to do is building a machine 
with the desired transformation proberties.

</B><BR><BR><I>
The parameter fname is the name of a file which contains the 
description of the transformation polynomial. 
The mode parameter is not used so far. The return value is a
pointer to the new machine and must be supplied in all other functions
described below. NULL is returned if an error has occured.
This function plays the role of a constructor  in C++-terminolgy. 
Note that you can not access the components of a TraceMachine 
structure. <p>

<A name=TMA_run>

</B><BR><BR><I>
A target coordinate is calculated from  the focalplane coordinate
supplied by fp. 
The right TraceMachine is chosen by tp which 
contains all intrinsic information.<p>

</B><BR><BR><I>
This function does all the necessary cleanup operations. On 
return all further access on tp is undefined. It is our destructor.<p>
