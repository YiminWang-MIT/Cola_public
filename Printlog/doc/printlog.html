<h1>Printlog++</h1>
<hr></center>

This program analizes the ECS logfiles and presents a graphical user
interface to display the ECS parameters. The interface bases on "HMView"
of the "HMBook" histogram package. 

The program creates a histogram for each parameter which will be displayed
as polyline. The names of the ECS parameter are translated by an "alias table"
to more comfortable names.

<h2><HR>Usage<HR></h2>
<dl>
<DT><b>Printlog++ </b><DD>

	Without parameter the file
        <blockquote>
            "~dbman/LOGFILES/log/opterm.*.*.*-*:*:*"
        </blockquote>
	will be analyzed, i.e. the current ECS logfile. This file will be read
        and after the end of the file, every 10 seconds an update will be
	attempted.<p>

	This is the standard use during beam time, the load for the 
        computer is negligible.<p>

<DT><b>Printlog++ -f filename</b><DD>

	With this command an elder opterm file can be analyzed. Usually
        the command<p> 

<DT><b>Printlog++ -zf filename.gz</b><DD>
        will be prefered. It will decompress the file first via "zcat".
	For several files the construction<p>  

<DT><b>[z]cat file1 file2 ... filen | Printlog++ -f -</b><DD>
	can be used as pipeline.<p>


<DT><b>export -n DISPLAY</b><DD>
<DT><b>Printlog++ -f filename -o histogramfile</b><DD>

	Use this to write batch jobs.
</dl>

<h2><HR>Further Options<HR> </h2>
<dl>
<DT><b>-b yymmddhhmmss</b><DD>
	
	(b like "begin") gives a start time for the analysis. The format
        is the same as the A1 run names or the "run.db" entries.<p>

	Abreviations:
	<blockquote><tt>
           yymmdd  	for yymmdd000000<br>
           yymmddhh  	for yymmddhh0000<br>
           yymmddhhmm  	for yymmddhhmm00<br>
	</blockquote></tt><p>
<DT><b>	
-b today</b><DD>

	start today at midnight<p>

<DT><b>-e yymmddhhmmss</b><DD>

	end time<p>
	The options -b and -e can be extracted from the current run.db
        by the shellscript "rundb-setup".

<DT><b>-h </b><DD>
	print some nearly useless help lines<p>

<DT><b>-o histogramfile</b><DD>
	save the histograms in a file. Useful for batch.<p>

</dl>

<h2><HR>Parameter File<HR></h2>

The file "Printlog.alias" will be read in the current working directory to
get a translation between the cryptic ECS names and "canonical" names. If you
don't like to have this file in each directory, you can set the
environment variable PRINTLOG_ALIAS as path to look for it. Use for example
the line
<blockquote>
           export PRINTLOG_ALIAS=~/.Printlog.alias
</blockquote>
in your ~/.profile file.

<p> Parameters, which are not translated via this file are stored in
the histogram directory 
<blockquote>
           [dbman]
</blockquote>
with their standard ECS name.<p>

Each line of the parameter file consists of four entries:

<blockquote>
           ECS-name subaddress aliasname unit
</blockquote>
