Hi, everybody,

the first serious version of the path-length corrections of OOPS-OHIPS
coincidence time, which originates in Tancredi's work with col files, is now
available from the Cola repository.  The method involves a polynomial
correction to raw tcoinc in target phi, dp, and theta of both spectrometers.
Obviously, this necessitates that both OOPS and OHIPS have some kind of
a track and, ideally, tcoinc is then given by

tc_corr = tc_raw + (timeOOPS-offsetOOPS) - (timeOHIPS-offsetOHIPS) - offset (1)

where

timeOOPS  = path_difference_OOPS / beta_OOPS / c_light
timeOHIPS = path_difference_OHIPS / beta_OHIPS / c_light

and all path differences are measured with respect to the length of the
central ray.  (All numbers are evaluated per-event.)  In a less ideal case,
either OOPS or OHIPS, and possibly both, will have valid TDCs (and hence
tc_raw), but will fail to have a track, so the path-length corrections
are not always fully calculable.  In order not to overload excessively
the online data structure, I have decided to provide the user with the
following variables:

	  online.oa_tc           raw O-A coinc time
	  online.oa_tccorr       corrected O-A coinc time
	  online.oa_tccorr_type  type of the correction applied

(analogously for O-B, O-C, O-D coincs).  So if you want e.g. to see
the full correction, use something like

     Cut (@online.oa_tccorr_type==3) {
       Histogram "OA tcoinccorr type 3" oa_tccorr("t?cc!", "ns", -50, 200, 500)
     }

in your col files.  The correction type is "3" if both OOPS and OHIPS
had tracks, and (1) is applicable.  Type "2" means that only OOPS failed
to produce a track, so only a part of (1) is done,

     tc_corr = tc_raw - (timeOHIPS-offsetOHIPS) - offset

and, vice-versa, if OHIPS failed, but OOPS has a track, we have type "1" and

     tc_corr = tc_raw + (timeOOPS-offsetOOPS) - offset

In the worst case, type is "0", and only

     tc_corr = tc_raw - offset

is done.  I think the usage of the correction "type" is a good diagnostic
tool and gives a look at the tcoinc spectrum from interesting perspectives
of background etc.

The parameters necessary for the corrections are included in initfiles
which are entered in the run.db similarly to the TMA initfiles, and are
initialized in a similar way.  In the run.db you should put

	OOPSA.tcc.initfile = "tccorr-OOPSshort.dat"
	OOPSB.tcc.initfile = "tccorr-OOPSshort.dat"
	OOPSC.tcc.initfile = "tccorr-OOPSshort.dat"
	OOPSD.tcc.initfile = "tccorr-OOPSshort.dat"
	OHIPS.tcc.initfile = "tccorr-OHIPSlong.dat"

(or other combinations of short/long).  I attach the four files (OOPS short,
OOPS long, OHIPS short, OHIPS long) we have so far.  You can put them
anywhere you wish, but when they become stable, we should accomodate them
somewhere into the /usr/local/oops/share directory.  The structure of the
files is the following (example of OOPS short):

 25.9539 -- offsetOOPS in equation (1) above

 4191.81 -- length of central ray in mm

 4 4     -- max powers in non-disp (phi) and disp (dp and theta) target coords

 0.3722414e-02  0.7369984e-16  0.2088084e-01  0  -- coefficients of
                                                    polynomial in phi

-0.1897446e+00  0.7841966e+00  0.6169280e-02  0
 0.3443232e+00  0.1012570e-01  0             -0.9075518e-04
 0.8435547e-02 -0.3611125e-03  0.2543812e-05 -0.2033473e-07
-0.3311019e-03  0.6901813e-05 -0.5609341e-07  0.1664401e-08

                                                 -- coefficients of
                                                    polynomial in dp, theta

For order of multiplication, see ColaMIT/TCCC.cc and ColaMIT/TCCC.h.

Attached also find sample histograms for N-D kinematics IIIa with OOPSA
and OOPSB.  (Do not ask me for now where the second peaks are coming from --
it could be that I accidentaly included some runs which are in a different
kinematics, since I do not have a copy of the logbooks.)  Also, the old
correction we used to apply to tcoinc in the "online days" became obsolete,
so look for entries of the sort

	COINC.O_tdc = { 127.49, 20.7899, 0, 0, 0 };
	COINC.A_tdc = { 124.17, 20.8794, -0.07, 20.0 };
	COINC.B_tdc = { 124.25, 20.9224, -0.07, 20.0 }; 
	COINC.C_tdc = { 124.23, 21.0516, -0.07, 20.0 }; 
	COINC.D_tdc = { 120.49, 21.0196, -0.07, 20.0 }; 

in your run.db's.  Only the first two numbers of each entry remain valid
(individual TDC's offset and slope), while the last three coefficients are
redundant and will cause parse errors or Cola crashes, so get rid of them.
I have also not bothered about any global offsets for now, e.g. "offset"
in eq. (1).  You know how to shift Scalars around in col files if you need it.
Please let me know in case you have problems of any kind.

Best regards, and have fun,

Simon
